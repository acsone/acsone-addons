==============
Workflow tasks
==============

This module automatically creates tasks when entering workflow activities.

In addition to workflow_activity_acion module, this one allow you to create tasks when an object enters on an activity.

Tasks must be configured on the activity concerned. It is possible to define a Deathline based on a date field and a critical delay during which the task is displayed in red.

To access a task, a user must:

1) be in a security group define in the Security page of the activity.
2) Have access to the object
