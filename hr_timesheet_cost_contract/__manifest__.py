HR Timesheet cost based on contract
===================================

Compute the cost of an employee for his timesheets according
to his contract definitions. The effective cost is calculated when
timesheet is 'Confirmed'. If no contract are defined, an exception
is raised.

This module is inspired from extra-trunk/hr_contract_timesheet that
updates the cost each time the unit_amount is changed but does
not warn if no contract exists.

Other known similar module:
    * extra-trunk/project_timesheet_contract relies on project.task.work

What we do here:
    * update the cost when the timesheet is confirmed (i.e. submitted)
    * prevent submission if no contract exists for the corresponding date
