HR Utilization Report
=====================

A module to produce a Utilization Table report.

A Utilization Table summarizes how employees spent time over a given period
and categories, as a percentage of the employee's full time schedule.

Each row correspond to an employee, and each column is a category.
Categories are fully configurable and typically have names such
Billable, Sales, Holidays, Sick, etc. A category is
defined as a set of analytic accounts, including their children accounts.

The report can also compute the number of full-time equivalent were active
in your company over any given period.

The hours used for the report come from timesheet lines, so it is of course
a prerequisite to have complete timesheets in order to produce meaningful
reports.

Follow the following steps to prepare and configure a report:
 * for each employee you want to include in the report, you need to have a
   Contract defined if Human Resources > Employees and associate a Working Time
   in the Working Schedule field (hours of employees with no contract or
   contract without a working schedule are printed in a separate section of
   the report);
 * in Settings > Companies, set the Working Time corresponding to a Full Time
   schedule on your company in the configuration tab;
 * in Settings > Technical > Resource, associate Resource
   Leaves corresponding to public holidays and other days your company is
   closed and associate these leaves to each Working Time;
 * in Human Resources > Configuration > Utilization, create columns (such as
   Billable, Sick, Holidays, etc) and link each column to the corresponding
   analytic accounts; children analytic accounts are included automatically,
   so if for instance your Billable projects are all under the same analytic
   account, you only need to include one;
 * in Human Resources > Configuration > Utilization, create a configuration
   listing all columns you want in your report; tick the 'With
   Full-time Equivalent Column' checkbox if you need the report to compute how
   many FTE you have over the period.

You can then print the report from Reporting > Human Resources > Utilization
Report, by selecting the configuration and the time period.

Caveats:
 * all analytic lines corresponding to timesheet lines must be in an analytic
   journal of type general (which is the OpenErp default);
 * the module currently assumes all timesheet lines quantities are in hours
   and does not attempt to verify if this assumption is valid.

The report is a webkit report. CSS and mako template are largely inspired by
c2c financial reports.
