HR timesheet sheet usability
============================

This module was written to add some usability improvements on hr timesheet sheet.

- Proposed month-end date for end date at the timesheet creation if it's the
  last week of the month.
- Proposed the last day of the week to end date at the timesheet creation if
  not last week of the month.
- Proposed the sheet end date as default date for the line if end date is
  lesser than today or start date if start date is greater than today.
